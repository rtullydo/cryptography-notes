<p>Part of understanding cryptography is understanding how attacks on cryptographic systems are performed. Since this is a mathematical cryptography course, we'll focus on mathematical attacks. Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the related Elgamal encryption system rely on the difficulty of the DLP for security. In this section, we'll look at some of the methods used to reduce the difficulty of attacking the DLP from the brute force case.</p>
