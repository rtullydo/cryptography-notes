<p>To make our study of difficulty precise, we need a way to quantify how hard a problem is to solve. In the cryptographic setting, difficulty will always scale in some way with the size of the numbers being used to construct a system, and we need a representation for how that scaling affects methods of solution. We'll use the notion of the <dfn class="terminology">order</dfn> of a function, usually called “big oh notation”, which is used to describe relationships depending on large quanitites. The information contained in a big O relationship is <em class="emphasis">asymptotic</em> - that is, it tells us what happens as values of the inputs get large, but shouldn't be expected to have any bearing on the relationship of quantities in small cases.</p>
