<p>Some obvious questions should arise on seeing this algorithm. The first is why we should expect a match at all? The answer is in the application of the humble yet consistently useful division algorithm. Suppose that \(x\) was the exponent so that \(g^x = h\text{.}\) Divide \(x\) by \(n\) and write \(x = nq + r\text{,}\) where \(0 \leq r \lt n\text{,}\) and further note that \(0 \leq q \lt n\text{.}\) To see this, since \(1\leq x \lt N\) (the order of an element in a finite group divides and thus is no larger than the order of the group)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
q = \frac{x - r}{n} \lt \frac{N}{n} \lt n
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where the last inequality follows from the fact that \(n \gt \sqrt{N}\text{.}\) Then since \(g^x = h\text{,}\) we get \(g^r = h\cdot g^{-nq}\text{,}\) where \(g^r\) is in the babystep list, and \(h \cdot g^{-nq}\) is in the giantstep list.</p>
