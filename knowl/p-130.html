<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Elliptic curves are one of the most active areas of study in mathematics. A special sort of graph arising from a simple family of polynomials, elliptic curves have proven to be deeply interesting objects of study in number theory, algebraic geometry, and mathematical cryptography. One of the most striking features of elliptic curves is that they provide an example of a group that has an operation that has nothing to do with multiplication or addition on real numbers. Yet the structure of the group allows it to be plugged in to a variety of cryptographic frameworks with little modification, including Diffie-Hellman key exchange and Elgamal encrpytion. As we will see, elliptic curve methods are also in wide use in the area of digital signatures.</p>
