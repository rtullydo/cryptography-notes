<p>As long as the curve \(E\) doesn't self-intersect (and we will see that there is a condition called the discriminant that will let us avoid that), the set of points in \(E\) form a group (see <a data-knowl="./knowl/def-group.html" title="Definition 3.5.1">DefinitionÂ 3.5.1</a>) but with a very different operation relating the points. It is most natural to use additive notation to describe elliptic curves, though the shift is only notational - the same rules apply, but we use \(0\) for the notion of additive identity and \(-a\) for the notion of additive inverse. While the discrete log problem in \(\F_p\ad\) is to undo a repeated multiplication, in \(E\text{,}\) the problem will be to undo a repeated addition.</p>
