<p>To summarize, we have shown that the operation \(\oplus\) on \(E\) is well-defined, has an identity, and has inverses. The last required property to be a group operation is that \(\oplus\) must be associative, but to prove that it is would require exhaustive analysis of cases, or deceptively inadequate pictures, or methods that are beyond the scope of this class. For now, we will take it on the assertion of experts that \(\oplus\) is indeed an associative operation.</p>
