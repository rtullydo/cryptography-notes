<p>As we showed in the previous section, given an elliptic curve \(E: Y^2 = X^3 + AX + B\text{,}\) we can form a group \(G = E \cup \{\mathcal O\}\) with the operation of elliptic addition. This object is a fascinating object of study. However, for cryptographic applications, and in particular groups of the size typical to cryptographic appliations, we have to reduce the group to a finite group. In the integer setting, we did this by reducing the integers \(\Z\) to the finite field \(\F_p\text{.}\) In the elliptic setting, we can perform the same maneuver by restricting an elliptic curve to just the points with integer coordinates in some finite field.</p>
