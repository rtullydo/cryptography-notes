<p>We should make some points about why elliptic curves are a tempting universe in which to do cryptography. First, unlike in \(\F_p\ad\text{,}\) inverses are trivial: if \(P = (x,y)\) then \(-P = (x, -y)\text{,}\) which makes computations much faster in Elgamal type settings. Second, and more importantly, unlike systems build on the integers and factoring problems, the fastest known algorithms that solve the ECDLP are exponential (on the order of \(O(\sqrt{N})\)), which allows the keyspace to be much smaller than methods amenable to attack by index calculus techniques (to be discussed after we talk about RSA).</p>
