<p>As a common divisor can be no larger than either of the numbers \(a\) and \(b\text{,}\) there always must be a largest such \(d\text{,}\) called the <dfn class="terminology">greatest common divisor</dfn>. We denote the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) with the symbol \(\gcd(a,b)\text{.}\) Finding a gcd is straightforward task in the case that the numbers are small - we can perform a factorization of the numbers, compare factors, and construct the gcd by multiplying all of the factors that the numbers have in common. For example, \(\gcd(128, 36) = 4\) because \(128 = 2^7\) and \(36 = 2^2 3^2\text{,}\) and thus the numbers share \(2^2\) as a common factor. However, at the scale of numbers used in cryptography, this is not an efficient method for finding a gcd.</p>
