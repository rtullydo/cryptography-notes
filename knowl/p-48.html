<p>The term ring refers to a set equipped with two operations, + and \(\cdot\text{,}\) that satisfy a certain number of algebraic properties characteristic of addition and multiplication in \(\Z\text{.}\) (Perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic is that there is a distributive property that intertwines the operations.) Rings are a central object in the study of modern algebra, along with groups, which are sets equipped with a single operation. In fact, we are just about to meet an extremely important group that lives inside \(\Z_n\ldots\)</p>
