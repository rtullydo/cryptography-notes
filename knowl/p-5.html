<p>The goal of the course is somewhat larger than explicating the central mathematical ideas of cryptosystems like RSA and ECC. Mathematical students typically see little more than the required introduction to programming courses, which are aimed at computer science students. Computer science students often see no more math than appears in their discrete mathematics course at the beginning of their courses of study. My goal is to show students something of the power that the two subjects have in combination: that mathematical concepts are extremely powerful when implemented in computer programs. The first version of this course was an independent study with a computer science student, and I was regularly surprised with the elegance of his implementations.</p>
