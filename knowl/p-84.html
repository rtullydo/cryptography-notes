<p>Let us suppose that, armed as we are with our knowledge of modular arithmetic and the algebra of finite fields, we are going to attempted to send information using that mathematics. Our friends Alice and Bob, intending to avoid the scrutiny of the devious Eve, are going to use this system to send information to teach other. To simplify matters, we will assume that the system that we are designing is <dfn class="terminology">symmetric</dfn> -- that is, that Alice and Bob share a secret piece of information.</p>
