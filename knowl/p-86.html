<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">However, as a cryptographic scheme, this method has some flaws. If Eve can get her hands on a single plaintext pair \((m,c)\) so that \(c\) is the encryption of \(m\text{,}\) then she can use the same computational methods to calculate \(k\text{.}\) This is called a <dfn class="terminology">plaintext attack</dfn> and our scheme is sadly vulnerable to it. A single pair is enough to break the entire system. Of course, if Alice and Bob could choose a new key each time, then the problem would be surmounted, but that goes to the question of HOW they can exchange a symmetric key each time they need a new one. (An answer to this question is the famous Diffie-Hellman key exchange to be discussed in the next section.)</p>
