<p>We should pause for a moment to talk about what we mean by easy and hard in the context of computational difficulty. We consider a calculation easy if it can be performed in seconds or less by a desktop computer. We consider a computation hard if the expected computation time is ten years or more harnessing all available computer power in world. There are two key points to make about this. One, we use the word <em class="emphasis">expected</em> - that is, there is a notion of probability involved. We could, in theory, solve a brute force check of a list with \(2^{1000}\) entries on the first try, but the probability is astronomically low.</p>
