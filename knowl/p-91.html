<p>The second thing to notice is that the definition of hard changes constantly with the development of new computational technology and techniques. Moore's Law is the observation that the number of transistors on dense integrated circuits (CPUs) has doubled every two years for decades. To keep computational problems hard, the size of keyspaces needs to increase accordingly. On the other hand, the invention of new technology can also change what is hard. It has been shown, for example, that working quantum computers will reduce some of the most important difficult math problems at the heart of modern cryptography into trivialities. This underscores the need to continue to develop new techniques in addition to enlarging the computational spaces.</p>
