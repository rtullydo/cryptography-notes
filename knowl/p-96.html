<p>The DHP provides an excellent illustration of the caution that needs to be taken when designing and evaluating a new cryptographic method. We should convince ourselves that the DHP is at least as difficult as the DLP. If Eve can solve the DLP, then she can obviously solve the DHP, since explicitly finding \(a,b\) would allow her to directly compute \(g^{ab}\text{.}\) That is to say, the DHP is at least as difficult as the DLP. (Note that the converse to this question is still unknown.)</p>
