<p>In their 1978 paper, Diffie and Hellman proposed a scheme called public key encryption, though they didn't provide an implementation. Two successful schemes that followed immediately from their work are the RSA family of methods (which are based on modular square roots) and the Elgamal family of methods (which are based on modular exponentiation). While RSA came first historically, the Elgamal cryptosystem is directly related to Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and so we are motivated to discuss it first. The Elgamal system is also readily adapted to more complicated setups, like groups on elliptic curves, which will be discussed later in this chapter.</p>
